# Geyser Fun(d): Implement an invoice view

## Task

Implement an invoice payment view based on the provided design.

## Requirements

* A user **must** be able to copy the invoice by clicking on the 
QR code
* The invoice QR code **must** appear in a pop up after a user clicks on a `Fund` button
* The modal **must** show a success screen when a payment goes through (you can mock the payment, no need to implement any payment logic)
